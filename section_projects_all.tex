{MultiModal Insight Engine}{Feb 2025 - Present}
{\website{Github}{https://github.com/apassuello/multimodal\_insight\_engine/}}
{Designed and implemented a full-stack training and evaluation platform for Transformer-based multimodal models.
Developed modules for mixed precision, quantization, and pruning; integrated benchmarking tools to compare performance across optimizations.
Built tokenizers and dataloaders for multilingual datasets (WMT, Europarl, IWSLT); supported joint BPE and custom preprocessing.
Integrated pretrained models (CLIP, ViT) with a unified interface for image-text tasks; implemented custom loss functions and schedulers.
Conducted safety evaluations via red teaming frameworks, adversarial generation, and prompt injection testing.}

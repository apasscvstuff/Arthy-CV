## Implementation Guidelines

### Content Transformation Workflow
1. **Identify core achievement** - What was accomplished?
2. **Extract quantifiable metric** - How much/how many/how fast?
3. **Determine business impact** - What value was created?
4. **Apply appropriate pattern** - Use \achievement{}{}{} or specific commands
5. **Set priority level** - Core (1), Standard (2), or Additional (3)
6. **Add role specificity** - Use techmetric/leadmetric as appropriate

### Best Practices
- **Always lead with action verbs**: Led, Developed, Achieved, Implemented
- **Quantify whenever possible**: Percentages, dollar amounts, timeframes
- **Focus on outcomes**: What changed as a result of your work?
- **Match metrics to audience**: Technical for firmware, business for executive
- **Use progressive disclosure**: Most important content first

### Testing Strategy
Each experience bullet should make sense across all versions:
- **Firmware**: Technical depth and implementation details
- **AI**: Research contributions and ML performance  
- **Consulting**: Client value and business impact
- **Executive**: Leadership results and financial impact
- **General**: Balanced overview highlighting versatility

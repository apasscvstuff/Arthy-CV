## Usage Guidelines

### Metric Selection by Role
1. **Choose 3-5 key metrics per role** to avoid overwhelming content
2. **Prioritize role-relevant numbers** (technical vs business vs leadership)
3. **Ensure metrics are defensible** with documentation/evidence
4. **Use conditional toggles** to show appropriate metrics per version

### Implementation in LaTeX
```latex
% Example usage with existing toggle system
\item Led firmware development achieving \whenrole{quantified}{96\% test coverage and }
      \whenrole{businessfocus}{\$2M milestone delivery}
      \whenrole{technical}{99.9\% system uptime during trials}
```

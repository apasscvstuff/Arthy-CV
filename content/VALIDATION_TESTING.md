## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue: Content appears in wrong version**
- Solution: Check toggle settings in config/cv-versions.tex
- Verify conditional logic uses correct toggle names

**Issue: Executive version too long**
- Solution: Review Priority 2 and 3 content
- Ensure \priority{1} wraps only essential content

**Issue: Missing quantified metrics**
- Solution: Check \metric{} and \businessimpact{} usage
- Verify quantified toggle is enabled for version

**Issue: Inconsistent formatting**
- Solution: Compare spacing and indentation
- Check for missing {} after conditionals

This comprehensive testing protocol ensures the enhanced CV system delivers professional, quantified, role-specific content across all 5 versions while maintaining ATS compatibility and visual consistency.

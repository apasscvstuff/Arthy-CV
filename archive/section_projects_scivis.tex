{Enterprise Technical Documentation RAG}{Jan 2025 - Present}
{\website{Github}{https://github.com/apassuello/technical-doc-rag/}| \website{Live Demo}{https://huggingface.co/spaces/apassuello/technical-rag/}}
{Engineered end-to-end RAG pipeline processing technical PDFs with 99.5\% optimal chunk rate through custom TOC-aware parsing and quality filtering.
Designed modular architecture with abstract interfaces enabling pluggable components for document processing, embedding, retrieval, and generation.
Implemented production features including streaming responses, session state management, multi-document indexing, and comprehensive error handling.
Achieved 10x search improvement over manual lookup through hybrid retrieval combining semantic understanding with keyword precision (70/30 weighting).
Deployed Streamlit application supporting real-time Q\&A on technical documentation with source citations and confidence scoring.}

{MultiModal Insight Engine}{Feb 2025 - Present}
{\website{Github}{https://github.com/apassuello/multimodal\_insight\_engine/}}
{Designed and implemented a full-stack training and evaluation platform for Transformer-based multimodal models.
Developed modules for mixed precision, quantization, and pruning; integrated benchmarking tools to compare performance across optimizations.
Built tokenizers and dataloaders for multilingual datasets (WMT, Europarl, IWSLT); supported joint BPE and custom preprocessing.
Integrated pretrained models (CLIP, ViT) with a unified interface for image-text tasks; implemented custom loss functions and schedulers.
Conducted safety evaluations via red teaming frameworks, adversarial generation, and prompt injection testing.}
